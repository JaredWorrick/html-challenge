## Instructions

* Create a DataFrame for a frame shop. The DataFrame should contain three columns,  "Frame", "Price", and "Sales", and have five rows of data stored within it.

* Using an alternative method, create a DataFrame for an art gallery. The DataFrame should contain three columns, "Painting", "Price", and "Popularity", and have four rows of data stored within it.

## Bonus

Once both DataFrames have been created, discuss which method you preferred and why.
