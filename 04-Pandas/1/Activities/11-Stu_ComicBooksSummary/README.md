# Comic Books Part 2

In this activity, you use some of Pandas’ built-in functions to create a new summary DataFrame based on the modified version of the comic book DataFrame.

## Instructions

Using the modified DataFrame that was created earlier, create a summary table for the dataset that includes the following pieces of information:

* The count of unique authors within the DataFrame

* The count of unique countries of publication within the DataFrame

* The year of the earliest published book in the DataFrame

* The year of the latest published book in the DataFrame
