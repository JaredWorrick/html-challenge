### Career Connection

Each week, students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This document relates each week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain Career Services tasks, and provides examples of technical interview questions, where applicable.

This week, please push the entire folder to the student repository so that students can access these files, and let students know that they can find related Career Services materials in this supplemental folder.

If you'd like more information about career services, visit our [Career Engagement Network page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp%29).
