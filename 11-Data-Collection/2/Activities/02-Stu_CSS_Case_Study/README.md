# CSS Case Study

In this activity, you’ll use CSS selectors in a basic web scraping example. First, you’ll use the class selector. Then, you’ll use the id selector.

## Instructions

* Import BeautifulSoup.

* Save the provided HTML code as a Python string.

* Convert the HTML string into a BeautifulSoup object.

* Use the `find_all` function to retrieve **all** of the elements that belong to the `odd` class. 

* Save the results to a variable.

* Display the results by using a `for` loop.

Now that you’ve identified HTML elements by using the CSS `class` selector, you’ll do the same but using the `id` selector. Recall that a `class` can contain multiple elements but that an `id` must be unique.

* Extract the text from a paragraph element that has an `id` of `first`.

* Print your result.
