# Mars News

In this activity, you'll get additional web scraping practice by collecting data from a website based on NASA's Mars News.

## Instructions

* First, open up [the website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) in Chrome and become familiar with the layout. In this exercise, you'll scrape the title and the summary of a news article.

* Right-click anywhere on the page, and then click Inspect. In DevTools, search for the HTML elements that you'll use to identify the title and the summary paragraph that you want. Remember to first look for the class of the `<div>` element associated with the news articles, then find the title and summary paragraph classes within that section.

* Now begin the scraping process by importing the necessary libraries and setting up Splinter.

* Use Splinter to visit the website and collect the html. Since this is a real website, you may want to add a delay that will allow the page to load. To do so, include the following code: `browser.is_element_present_by_css('div.list_text', wait_time=1)`. This code accomplishes the following:

    1. The `is_element_present_by_css method` searches for elements with a specific combination of tag (`div`) and attribute (`list_text`), both of which are needed to find the news articles.
    2. The parameter `wait_time=1` tells the browser to wait one second before searching for the specified components.

* Create a BeautifulSoup parser to parse the html from the website.

* Use the `select_one` method from Beautiful Soup to search the html for a `<div>` tag that has the class associated with the news articles. Store your result in a variable.

    > **Note:** The `select_one` method is used to find only the first tag that matches a selector. For example:
    > 
    > ```python
    > soup.select_one(".help_link")
    > # <a class="help_link" href="/help" id="link1">Help</a>
    > ```

* Now find the title of the news article you selected by using the `find` method and the class associated with the article titles. Print your result.

* Use the `get_text` method to extract the text of the news article title that you scraped, and print your result. 

* Now find the summary of the news article you selected by using the `find` method and the class associated with the article summary. Print your result.

* Use the `get_text` method to extract the text of the news article summary that you scraped, and print your result. 

* Congratulations on scraping this NASA website! Now that you have finished, quit your browsing session.

## Hints

* Use the Beautiful Soup documentation for [`get_text`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#get-text)
