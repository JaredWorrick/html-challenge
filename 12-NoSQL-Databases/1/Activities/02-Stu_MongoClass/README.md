# Mongo Class

In this activity, you will learn basic query operations in MongoDB. Specifically, you'll practice inserting and finding documents.

## Instructions

1. Use the command line to create a `classDB` database.

2. Insert entries into this database for yourself and other students within a collection called `classroom`. Each document should have:
  * A name field for the person's `name`
  * A `favorite_python_library` field for the person's favorite Python library
  * An `age` field for the person's age
  * A `hobbies` field for a list of that person's hobbies.

3. Use the `find()` commands to get a list of everyone of a specific age, then use `name` to collect the entry for a single person.
