# Aggregate by Classification

In this activity, you will practice using the aggregate method in MongoDB.

## Instructions

* In Jupyter Notebook, open [AggregateByClassification_unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/AggregateByClassification_unsolved.ipynb). Run the first two blocks of code to import your dependencies, create an instance of the MongoClient, and save the database and collection to variables.

* Write an aggregation query that counts the number of documents, grouped by "classification".

* Run the query with the aggregate method and save the results to a variable.

* Print the number of classifications in the result.

* Print the first 10 results.

* Convert mongo result to Pandas DataFrame.

* Display the first 10 rows of the Pandas DataFrame.
