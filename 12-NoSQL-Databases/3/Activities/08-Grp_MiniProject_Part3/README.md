# MongoDB Mini-Project Part 3: Plotting the Data

For Part 3 of the mini-project, you will practice plotting Mongo results with Matplotlib. 

## Instructions

You may use the starter code provided, which contains code for an aggregation pipeline and resulting normalized DataFrame, which you can practice plotting with Matplotlib. However, you are also welcome to write your own aggregation pipeline to plot the data. 

If there is enough remaining time at the end of the class, groups will be invited to present their charts to the class.

You may wish to review your Matplotlib content in order to complete the mini-project, but this is an exciting time to see how you can integrate different skills you have learned throughout the course. Feel free to also review the [Pandas Plot documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html)

You are welcome to use whatever type of chart you think will best represent the results from your aggregation pipeline, or use the starter code comments as a guide.

Use `plt.savefig()` to save your chart(s).
