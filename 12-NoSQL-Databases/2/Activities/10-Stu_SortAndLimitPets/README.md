# Sort and Limit Pets

In this activity, you will revisit the data from Petsitly Marketing and practice writing queries while using the sort and limit methods with PyMongo.

## Instructions

* Open [SortAndLimitPets_unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/SortAndLimitPets_unsolved.ipynb) and run the first few blocks of code to connect to the database and store the `customer_list` collection as a variable.

* Create a query that finds customers who have cats or dogs, then sorts in descending order by `2021_Total_Spend`, and limits the results to the first 5. Pretty print the results.

* Create a query that finds customers who spent less than $500 in 2021, then sorts in ascending order by `Customer_Last`, and limits the results to the first 5. Pretty print the results.

* Pretty print the results of a query that:

    * Finds customers who spent less than $500 **and** had more than 20 visits in 2021.

    * Removes the `Address` and `Email` fields from the results.

    * Sorts in ascending order by `2021_Visits`, then `2021_Total_Spend`.

    * Limits the results to the first 8.
