# Find Pets

In this activity, you will revisit the data from Petsitly Marketing and practice using comparison operators in MongoDB with PyMongo.

## Instructions

* Open [FindPets_Unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/FindPets_Unsolved.ipynb) and follow the instructions at the top of the notebook to import the Petsitly data again.

* Create a query that finds the customers who had over 50 visits in 2021 and pretty print the first two results.

* Create a query that finds the customers who spent $250 or less in 2021 and pretty print the first two results.

* Create a query that finds the customer(s) who live in an apartment with "Suite" in the address and pretty print the first three results.

* Create a query that finds the customers who have turtles or fish and pretty print the first three results.

## Hint

* The `$regex` operator is used to match partial strings.

* For the other comparison operators, consult the MongoDB documentation on [comparison operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/).
